I am a future Computer Science graduate diving into the world of coding with a strong foundation in C programming. I have a proactive learning style, a collaborative mindset, and a passion for solving complex problems through efficient code.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Machine Learning projects**  
  Exploring real-world applications of machine learning, such as stock price prediction, house price prediction, and handwritten digit classification.  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Machine Learning and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**  
  Enhancing my problem-solving skills and understanding of complex algorithms while diving deeper into machine learning techniques.  

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **open-source projects and research in AI/ML**  
  Excited to contribute to real-world machine learning applications and collaborate with like-minded developers.  

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **advanced machine learning concepts and model optimization**  
  Open to learning more about deep learning architectures, model fine-tuning, and improving ML model efficiency.  

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **guitar and Machine Learning**  
  Besides coding, I have a passion for music and love playing the guitar! Feel free to ask me anything about ML as well.  

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **hritikshah02@gmail.com**  
  Always open to networking, collaborations, and discussions about technology and coding.  

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: **He/Him**  
  Just so you know how to refer to me!  

- âš¡ Fun fact: **I love solving coding challenges and debugging complex problems!**  
  Finding and fixing a bug in the code gives me the same satisfaction as solving a difficult puzzle!
